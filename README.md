# MatrixSim-
High-Performance Matrix Multiplication Performance Modeling A configurable simulator that models matrix multiplication performance by simulating memory latency, MAC unit utilization, precision modes, sparsity, and multi-threadingâ€”ideal for understanding hardware-software co-optimization.

Key Features:
Cycle-Accurate Simulation: Models memory latency and MAC unit operations in cycles, providing insights into the performance of matrix multiplication on various hardware configurations.
Parallelization: Supports multi-threading for concurrent computation across multiple MAC units, reducing time complexity and improving scalability.
Precision Modes (INT8, FP32): Models performance for different data precision formats to help optimize resource usage based on workload needs.
Sparsity-Aware Execution: Accounts for sparse matrices, skipping operations for zero values to improve performance for real-world machine learning workloads.
Memory Bandwidth Modeling: Simulates the impact of memory bandwidth and memory access latency on the overall performance.
Customizable Configurations: Supports configurable input matrix sizes, precision, sparsity levels, and hardware parameters (e.g., MAC units, memory latency) for flexibility.
Performance Metrics: Provides key performance metrics such as total cycles, compute cycles, memory load cycles, and utilization rates, helping identify bottlenecks in the simulation.
